# .doom.d
This is my current configuration for Doom Emacs.

The entire configuration is written in org-mode (which is awesome btw) and can be found in a readable form [here](config.org).
## How to install
Follow the guide in the [doom emacs repository](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs#install).
